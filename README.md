# _Arabidopsis thaliana_ isomiR annotation from sRNA-seq datasets


 Here, you'll find essential [IsoMiRmap](https://cm.jefferson.edu/isoMiRmap/) lookup tables for annotating isomiRs of _Arabidopsis thaliana_, curated and organized for user convenience.

## Lookup Tables:

1. **ath_LookupTable_isomiRs_miRBase_v22.txt**  
   This file contains a 'k-mer lookup table' that enables fast mapping while ensuring thorough isomiR mining. Each entry represents a candidate isomiR sequence of k nucleotides, where k ranges from 18 to 26.

2. **ath_Mature_Coordinates_miRBasev22_TAIR10.txt**  
   This file contains the coordinates of mature miRNAs from miRBase.

3. **ath_MiRNAspace_HairpinSequences_miRBase_v22_TAIR10.fa**  
   This file includes a FASTA format of hairpin miRNAs from miRBase.

4. **ath_RepeatMakerClassIslands_miRBase_v22.txt**  
   This file contains repeat islands to determine whether the isomiR can be found within a known repeat element.

5. **ath_SNPtable_miRBase_v22.txt**  
   This file contains sequences that exhibit SNP variations(1001 Genomes Project) compared to the reference isomiR sequence.


These are the tables used to annotate isomiRs avaialable is athisomiRDB.

Feel free to explore and leverage these files for your isomiR analysis in _Arabidopsis thaliana_.
